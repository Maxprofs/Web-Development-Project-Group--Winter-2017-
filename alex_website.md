# Website Winter Term 2017
### Mentor: Vincent La

This repository discusses my personal website made with UCSB Data Science Club, encompassing HTML, CSS, Python and Django.

##**Overview**##
My main purpose for creating a website is to showcase my statistical projects online (as well as on inertia7), and also to become more familar with certain programming languages. Firstly, I created a very basic 'rookie' website, mainly made from HTML and CSS, to get a simple jist of everything. Now I am editing very specific items to improve the appearance and professionalism of the website. Finally, I hope to actually deploy the site by learning to find a host and buy a domain name.

##**Things to do**##
+ Complete finishing touches of site appearance (mostly CSS work)
+ Upload a few class projects
+ Get host and domain name
+ Learn about JavaScript for future interactive features
