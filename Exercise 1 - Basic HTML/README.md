## Part 3: Practice
Here comes the fun part... creating an HTML document from scratch!

1. Start with a bare-minimum HTML document
This is the bare-minimum amount of code that comprises a valid HTML file.

 * Either use the one provided by Mozilla when you read "Creating hyperlinks" orâ€¦
 * Use http://vincela.com/html/#basics (just the section that says "A Bare-Minimum HTML Document")
  * Download 'bare_minimum.html'

2. Mark up this letter
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Marking_up_a_letter

 * Use the W3C validator mentioned: https://validator.w3.org/
  * Try to see if you can get your code to pass!

### Some Hints
#### Line Breaks
You should never use a line break to separate paragraphs. The correct way to create separate paragraphs is to wrap the paragraphs in ```<p></p>``` tags. The line break will then be created automatically.

If you want to create a line break within a paragraph, or any other element, use ```<br />```.

#### Styling
1. Copy and paste the CSS into a separate file. Save it in the same directory as "letter.css"
2. Add <link href="letter.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"> to the <head> section of your HTML document
3. Any time you want to make any text right-aligned, you will set the container element's class attribute to "receiver-column", e.g.
 1. ```<p class="receiver-column">```
 2. Note: You might need multiple ```<p>```'s and ```<address>```'s to mark up the header!
